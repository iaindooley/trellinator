The Modules on the right hand side will give you an overview of each group of classes.

Each class is also listed for quick reference in the Classes list below.

If you haven't already done the <a href="http://docs.trellinator.com/trellinator_hello_world.pdf">Hello World tutorial</a>, that's a good place to start.

If you'd like someone to do the development work for you, or you'd like to have your Trellinator code hosted rather than setting it up in Google Sheets, check out <a href="http://www.benkobot.com/">BenkoBot</a>.
